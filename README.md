Here's an updated README file for the calculator app built with React.js:

React Calculator App
This is a simple calculator app built with React.js useState Hooks and eval() function that can club different operations together in a single expression that cannot be done using 2 operands at a time only, and also it perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, invert input operand sign and simple percentage that perform /100 on an individual input operand. This % is not as efficient and functional as that present in calculator which can calculate discounted prices, appreciated prices increasing at a fixed rate and even multiplication and division by percentage in which percentage is evaluated as percentage of the previously evaluated expression using operands and operators before using the operand and operator before the % sign and then the final result is calculated unlike the one developed by me in which % represents something as a fraction of 100. Also some issue is there in decimal and leading 0 and consecutive 0 handling as well as 01 = 1 like case handling and error may be there on encountering repeated operations just using 0. In that case it is advised and preferable to use All Clear i.e C Button that will make the screen Blank and not reset to 0. 
Don't use '=' operator consecutively it raises error which had not been handled using exception/error handling. If some error use Clear Button and retry in some other way.
<h1>Rest all operations will be working perfect and also it's better to use Clear after using '=' if any error is there. All basic operations can be done using the developed calculator using the one or the other many (all) ways. <h1>

Basic Features present in the app for basic Arithmetic Numerical expression evaluation and simple calculations :-

1) Addition
2) Subtraction
3) Multiplication
4) Division
5) Invert Sign of operand
6) Basic Percentage not as advance and flexible as best device calculators.
